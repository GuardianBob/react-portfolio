                                I’ve traveled to over 30 different countries, set foot on 5 continents, sailed across two oceans, 
                            crossed the equator and the international date line, missed all the signs pointing to where I should 
                            go professionally and still made it here somehow! <br/><br/>
                            I love being able to build something and watch it come to life.  I’m a logic-minded creative type that loves a 
                            good challenge and solving problems.  I can quickly pick up new skills and technologies and found that I have a 
                            passion for process improvement and automation.  I’ve always had a thing for coding and no matter what path I 
                            took away from it, I always seemed to come back around.  <br/><br/>
                            It all started with building personal pages on Geocities and Angelfire as a teenager.  After six years in 
                            the Navy I decided to start up a business with a friend, during which time I taught myself graphic design and 
                            web development.  Eventually I veered off into the realm of business, earned two bachelor's degrees in business, 
                            got certified as a Project Management Professional and went into project planning and analyst roles.  While in these roles I quickly 
                            noticed that  some of my work could be automated so I taught myself VBA and began writing macros for Excel and MS 
                            Project.  After a while I wanted to start automating even more tasks such as processing and analyzing data along 
                            with report generation.  I picked up VB.net and wrote a couple of Windows applications that ended up allowing 
                            several development teams to better analyze and allocate their resources, greatly improving their project 
                            planning accuracy.  <br/><br/>
                            After getting a Master’s in Management Information Systems I looked at getting into a more technical analyst role 
                            with systems analysis but lacked experience in Python.  Finally I decided to take the leap from the business 
                            side to programming and enrolled in a Python bootcamp at Coding Dojo.  I’ve had enough experience with front-end 
                            and back-end development that I can honestly say I enjoy both but really love back-end development because of my 
                            drive for process improvement.  My strongest coding languages are Python, Django, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery.  
                            I’m also experienced with AJAX, APIs, VB.net and G-Code (CNC programming... yes, I have a wood carving robot).
